=== UltiSnips ===

Snippets. Yay!

Stored in: ~/.vim/schilk_snips/

Run :UltiSnipsEdit to add/change snippet (for current file-type)

Configured to not include default snippets (may change in future?)

Default configuration in vimrc disables UltiSnip's own
expansion hotkey, as coc-snippets is used. (See [[CoC]])

While expanding, use <C-j> to move to next insertion point
