CoC itself is a standard vim-plug install (see vimrc).

It will require some extensions for different languages, which are installed with :CocInstall 

These extensions may need further configuration/setup.

The large amounts of key-bindings and configurable vim script associated with CoC, are kept in ~/.vim/coc.vim,
which is sourced from the main .vimrc.

Configuration of CoC and it's extensions takes place in ~/.vim/coc-settings.json (:CocConfig)

= Extensions: =
    * [[coc-clangd]]
    * [[coc-pyright]]
    * coc-snippets 
    * coc-json
